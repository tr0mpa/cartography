### Ontology Properties on Nodes

Cartography's ontology system supports two distinct patterns for organizing and querying data across modules:

#### 1. Abstract Ontology Nodes

Abstract ontology nodes (e.g., `User`, `Device`) are **dedicated nodes created separately** from module-specific nodes. They serve as unified, cross-module representations of entities.

**How it works:**
- Cartography creates new ontology nodes (`:User`, `:Device`) based on mappings from multiple source modules
- These nodes aggregate and normalize data from module-specific nodes
- Relationships link ontology nodes to their source nodes (e.g., `(:User)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:EntraUser)`)

#### 2. Semantic Labels (Extra Labels)

Semantic labels (e.g., `UserAccount`, `APIKey`) are **extra labels added directly** to module-specific nodes. They enable unified querying without creating separate nodes.

**How it works:**
- Module nodes receive an additional label (e.g., `:EntraUser:UserAccount`, `:AnthropicApiKey:APIKey`)
- Ontology mappings add normalized `_ont_*` properties to these nodes
- The `_ont_source` property tracks which module provided the data
- No separate ontology nodes are created; the module node itself carries the semantic label

#### Ontology Properties (`_ont_*`)

When mappings are applied, nodes automatically receive `_ont_*` properties with normalized ontology field values:

- **Cross-module querying**: Use consistent field names across different modules
- **Data normalization**: Access standardized field values regardless of source format
- **Source tracking**: The `_ont_source` property indicates which module provided the data

:::{important}
Semantic-label queries should use the documented `_ont_*` field names directly, for example `_ont_name`, `_ont_region`, or `_ont_source`.
If you still have queries using `_ont_id`, update them to the current field that represents that concept for the semantic label you are querying.
:::

### User

```{note}
User is an abstract ontology node.
```

A user is a person (or agent) who uses a computer or network service.
A user often has one or many user accounts.

```{important}
If field `active` is null, it should not be considered as `true` or `false`, only as unknown.
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **id** | The unique identifier for the user. |
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first created this node. |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated. |
| email | User's primary email. |
| username | Login of the user in the main IDP. |
| fullname | User's full name. |
| firstname | User's first name. |
| lastname | User's last name. |
| active | Boolean indicating if the user is active (e.g. disabled in the IDP). |

#### Relationships

- `User` has one or many `UserAccount` (semantic label):
    ```
    (:User)-[:HAS_ACCOUNT]->(:UserAccount)
    ```
- `User` can own one or many `Device`:
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:Device)
    ```
  Jamf device emails, CrowdStrike host emails, and provider-native ownership edges are examples of signals Cartography can use to derive this relationship.
- `User` can own one or many `APIKey` (semantic label):
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:APIKey)
    ```

### UserAccount

```{note}
UserAccount is a semantic label.
```

A user account represents an identity on a specific system or service.
Unlike the abstract `User` node, `UserAccount` is a semantic label applied to concrete user nodes from different modules, enabling unified queries across platforms.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_email | User's email address (often used as primary identifier). |
| _ont_username | User's login name or username. |
| _ont_fullname | User's full name. |
| _ont_firstname | User's first name. |
| _ont_lastname | User's last name. |
| _ont_has_mfa | Whether multi-factor authentication is enabled for this account. |
| _ont_inactive | Whether the account is inactive, disabled, suspended, or locked. |
| _ont_lastactivity | Timestamp of the last activity or login for this account. |
| _ont_source | Source of the data. |


### UserGroup

```{note}
UserGroup is a semantic label.
```

A user group represents a logical grouping of users or resources within a cloud provider or SaaS platform.
Groups are a key part of the identity graph and enable attack path analysis through group membership relationships.
Unlike the abstract `User` node, `UserGroup` is a semantic label applied to concrete group nodes from different modules, enabling unified queries across platforms.

Common group concepts across platforms include:
- **Cloud IAM**: AWS IAM Groups, AWS SSO Groups, OCI Groups, Scaleway Groups
- **Identity Providers**: Entra Groups, Okta Groups, Keycloak Groups, Google Workspace Groups, GSuite Groups
- **Collaboration**: GitHub Teams, GitLab Groups, Slack Groups, PagerDuty Teams

| serial_number | Device serial number. |

#### Relationships

- `Device` is linked to one or many nodes that implements the notion into a module
    ```
    (:User)-[:HAS_REPRESENTATION]->(:*)
    ```
- `User` can own one or many `Device`
    ```
    (:User)-[:OWNS]->(:Device)
    ```
  This relationship may be derived from provider signals such as Jamf device emails, CrowdStrike host emails, or native provider ownership edges.

| _ont_created_at | Timestamp when the instance was created. |


### Container

```{note}
Container is a semantic label.
```

A container represents a lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.
It generalizes concepts like ECS Containers, Kubernetes Containers, individual containers within Azure Container Groups (`AzureContainerInstance`), and individual containers within GCP Cloud Run Services (`GCPCloudRunServiceContainer`) and Jobs (`GCPCloudRunJobContainer`).

```{note}
GCP Cloud Run Services, Jobs and Revisions are themselves **not** modeled as `Container` (and no longer as `Function` either). Services and Jobs are orchestrators (analogous to `ECSService` / AWS Batch); Revisions are pure versioning markers for Services. Their per-container specs are materialized as child `GCPCloudRunServiceContainer` / `GCPCloudRunJobContainer` nodes that carry `:Container` and `RESOLVED_IMAGE`.
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_name | The name of the container. |
| _ont_image | The container image (e.g., nginx:latest). |
| _ont_image_digest | The digest/SHA256 of the container image. |
| _ont_state | The current state of the container (e.g., running, stopped, waiting). |

| _ont_region | The region or zone where the container is running. |
| _ont_namespace | Namespace for logical isolation (e.g., Kubernetes namespace). |
| _ont_health_status | The health status of the container. |

#### Relationships

- `Container` references the image it was asked to run via `HAS_IMAGE` (created at ingest time by matching container runtime digest to image digest). The target may be either a single-platform `Image` or an `ImageManifestList`:
    ```
    (:Container)-[:HAS_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    (:Container)-[:HAS_IMAGE]->(:ImageManifestList)
    ```
- `Container` is connected to a concrete single platform `Image` that actually ran via `RESOLVED_IMAGE`. This edge is produced by the `resolved_image_analysis.json` analysis job, which runs after the ontology stage. It is only created when the target can be deterministically identified:
    - When `HAS_IMAGE` already points at an `:Image` (not `:ImageManifestList`), `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created directly.
    - When `HAS_IMAGE` points at an `:ImageManifestList`, `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created to the child `:Image` reached via `CONTAINS_IMAGE` whose architecture matches the container's `architecture_normalized`. If zero or more than one child match, no edge is created (determinism guard).
    ```
    (:Container)-[:RESOLVED_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```

### ThirdPartyApp

```{note}
ThirdPartyApp is a semantic label.
```

An OAuth application (or OAuth client) represents a third-party application that has been authorized to access user data via OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SAML protocols.
OAuth apps span across identity providers (Google Workspace, Okta, Entra, Keycloak) and represent potential security risks when users grant excessive permissions.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_client_id | The OAuth client ID - unique identifier for the application (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_name | Human-readable display name of the OAuth application (REQUIRED). |
| _ont_enabled | Whether the OAuth application is currently enabled/active. |
| _ont_native_app | Whether this is a native/mobile application (vs web application). |
| _ont_protocol | The authentication protocol used (e.g., oauth2, openid-connect, saml). |
| _ont_source | Source module of the data (e.g., googleworkspace, keycloak, entra, okta). |


#### Relationships

- `User` can authorize `ThirdPartyApp` (for modules that track user-level OAuth authorizations):
    ```
    (:User)-[:AUTHORIZED]->(:ThirdPartyApp)
    ```


### DNSZone

```{note}
DNSZone is a semantic label.
```

A DNS zone represents a managed DNS zone across different cloud providers and DNS services.

A service account represents a non-human identity used for automation and inter-service communication.
Unlike user accounts, service accounts are designed for programmatic access and workload identity.

Common service account concepts across platforms include:
- **Cloud Providers**: GCP Service Accounts, AWS Service Principals
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes Service Accounts
- **SaaS Platforms**: OpenAI Service Accounts, Scaleway Applications

| Field | Description |

| _ont_runtime | The runtime environment (e.g., python3.9, nodejs18.x, dotnet6). Only applicable for code-based functions. |
| _ont_memory | Memory allocated to the function (in MB). |
| _ont_timeout | Timeout for function execution (in seconds). |
| _ont_deployment_type | The deployment type: `code` for source-code functions, `container` for container-image functions. Derived per-provider: AWS Lambda maps `PackageType` (`Zip`→`code`, `Image`→`container`); Azure Function App maps `is_container`; GCP Cloud Functions are always `code`. |
| _ont_image | The container image reference (populated when the function is container-deployed: Lambda `PackageType=Image`, Azure Function App with `DOCKER|...`). |
| _ont_image_digest | Content-addressable digest (`sha256:...`) of the container image, when the reference is digest-pinned. |

#### Relationships

- `Function` is connected to the concrete single platform `Image` it actually ran via `RESOLVED_IMAGE`. This edge is produced by the `resolved_image_analysis.json` analysis job and covers container-based functions that expose a container image reference:
    - **AWSLambda** (`PackageType=Image`) has `HAS_IMAGE` on the node itself — `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created directly.
    - **AzureFunctionApp** (`is_container=true`) has `HAS_IMAGE` on the node itself — `RESOLVED_IMAGE` is created directly.
    - **GCPCloudRunService** and **GCPCloudRunJob** do NOT carry `:Function`. They are orchestrators (analogous to `ECSService` and AWS Batch). Their per-container specs are materialized as child `GCPCloudRunServiceContainer` / `GCPCloudRunJobContainer` nodes that carry `:Container` and participate in `RESOLVED_IMAGE` via the `:Container` path.
    - When `HAS_IMAGE` points at an `:ImageManifestList`, the determinism guard from the `Container` section applies (single arch-matching child required).
    ```
    (:Function)-[:RESOLVED_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```


### CodeRepository

It generalizes concepts like AWS ECRRepositoryImage, GCP Artifact Registry image tags, and GitLab Container Registry tags.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_tag | The tag name (e.g., "latest", "v1.0.0"). |
| _ont_uri | The full URI to the tagged image. |

#### Relationships

- `ImageTag` points to one or many `Image`:
    ```
    (:ImageTag)-[:IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```


### Image

```{note}
Image is a conditional semantic label applied to container image nodes when `type="image"`.
```

An image represents a runnable container image (single-architecture or platform-specific).
It generalizes concepts like AWS ECRImage (type=image), GCP Container Images, and GitLab Container Images.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_digest | The content-addressable digest (SHA256) of the image. |
| _ont_architecture | CPU architecture (e.g., "amd64", "arm64"). |
| _ont_os | Operating system (e.g., "linux", "windows"). |
| _ont_variant | Architecture variant (e.g., "v8" for ARM). |

#### Relationships

- `Image` can be linked to the public base image identified by Docker Scout:
    ```
    (:Image)-[:BUILT_ON]->(:DockerScoutPublicImage)
    ```

- `TrivyPackage` nodes discovered by Trivy are deployed on an `Image`:
    ```
    (:TrivyPackage)-[:DEPLOYED]->(:Image)
    ```

- `SyftPackage` nodes discovered by Syft are deployed on an `Image`:
    ```
    (:SyftPackage)-[:DEPLOYED]->(:Image)
    ```

- `TrivyImageFinding` vulnerabilities discovered by Trivy affect an `Image`:
    ```
    (:TrivyImageFinding)-[:AFFECTS]->(:Image)
    ```

- Canonical `Package` nodes are deployed on an `Image` (propagated from TrivyPackage and SyftPackage):
    ```
    (:Package)-[:DEPLOYED]->(:Image)
    ```


### ImageAttestation

```{note}
ImageAttestation is a conditional semantic label applied to container image nodes when `type="attestation"`.
```

An image attestation represents cryptographic metadata that validates or provides provenance information about a container image.
It generalizes concepts like AWS ECRImage attestations and OCI attestation manifests.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_digest | The content-addressable digest (SHA256) of the attestation. |
| _ont_attestation_type | The type of attestation (e.g., "attestation-manifest"). |
| _ont_attests_digest | The digest of the image this attestation validates. |

#### Relationships

- `ImageAttestation` attests an `Image`:
    ```
    (:ImageAttestation)-[:ATTESTS]->(:Image)
    ```


### ImageManifestList

```{note}
ImageManifestList is a conditional semantic label applied to container image nodes when `type="manifest_list"`.
```

An image manifest list (also known as an image index) represents a multi-architecture container image that contains references to platform-specific images.
It generalizes concepts like AWS ECRImage manifest lists and OCI image indexes.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_digest | The content-addressable digest (SHA256) of the manifest list. |
| _ont_child_image_digests | List of platform-specific image digests contained in this manifest list. |

#### Relationships

- `ImageManifestList` contains platform-specific `Image` nodes:
    ```
    (:ImageManifestList)-[:CONTAINS_IMAGE]->(:Image)
    ```


### ImageLayer

```{note}
ImageLayer is a semantic label.
```

An image layer represents an individual filesystem layer within a container image.
Layers are de-duplicated by their content-addressable digest, so multiple images may reference the same layer node.
It generalizes concepts like AWS ECRImageLayer and OCI image layers.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _ont_diff_id | The uncompressed (DiffID) SHA-256 digest of the layer. |
| _ont_is_empty | Boolean flag identifying Docker's canonical empty layer. |
| _ont_history | The shell command that created this layer (for Dockerfile matching). |

#### Relationships

- `Image` has layers:
    ```
    (:Image)-[:HAS_LAYER]->(:ImageLayer)
    ```
- Layers point to the next layer in sequence:
    ```
    (:ImageLayer)-[:NEXT]->(:ImageLayer)
    ```
