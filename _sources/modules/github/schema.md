#### Relationships

- GitHubUsers or GitHubOrganizations own GitHubRepositories.

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[OWNER]->(GitHubRepository)
    (GitHubOrganization)-[OWNER]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories in an organization can have [outside collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#collaboratoraffiliation) who may be granted different levels of access, including ADMIN,
WRITE, MAINTAIN, TRIAGE, and READ ([Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission)).

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[:OUTSIDE_COLLAB_{ACTION}]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories in an organization also mark all [direct collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#collaboratoraffiliation), folks who are not necessarily 'outside' but who are granted access directly to the repository (as opposed to via membership in a team).  They may be granted different levels of access, including ADMIN,
WRITE, MAINTAIN, TRIAGE, and READ ([Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission)).

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[:DIRECT_COLLAB_{ACTION}]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories use ProgrammingLanguages
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:LANGUAGE]->(ProgrammingLanguage)
    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubBranches
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:BRANCH]->(GitHubBranch)
    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubBranchProtectionRules.
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:HAS_RULE]->(GitHubBranchProtectionRule)
    ```
- GitHubTeams can have various levels of [access](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission) to GitHubRepositories.

  ```
  (GitHubTeam)-[ADMIN|READ|WRITE|TRIAGE|MAINTAIN]->(GitHubRepository)
  ```

- GitHubUsers who have committed to GitHubRepositories in the last 30 days are tracked with commit activity data.

  ```
  (GitHubUser)-[:COMMITTED_TO]->(GitHubRepository)
  ```

  This relationship includes the following properties:
  - **commit_count**: Number of commits made by the user to the repository in the last 30 days
  - **last_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's most recent commit to the repository
  - **first_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's oldest commit to the repository within the 30-day period

- GitHubRepositories can have Semgrep findings (optional, requires Semgrep integration).

    ```
    (SemgrepSASTFinding)-[:FOUND_IN]->(GitHubRepository)
    (SemgrepSCAFinding)-[:FOUND_IN]->(GitHubRepository)
    (SemgrepSecretsFinding)-[:FOUND_IN]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

### GitHubOrganization

Representation of a single GitHubOrganization [organization object](https://developer.github.com/v4/object/organization/). This node contains minimal data for the GitHub Organization.

    ```

- GitHubUsers relate to GitHubOrganizations in a few ways:
  - Most typically, they are members of an organization.
  - They may also be org admins (aka org owners), with broad permissions over repo and team settings.  In these cases, they will be graphed with two relationships between GitHubUser and GitHubOrganization, both `MEMBER_OF` and `ADMIN_OF`.
  - In some cases there may be a user who is "unaffiliated" with an org, for example if the user is an enterprise owner, but not member of, the org.  [Enterprise owners](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owners) have complete control over the enterprise (i.e. they can manage all enterprise settings, members, and policies) yet may not show up on member lists of the GitHub org.

    ```

- GitHubEnvironments have environment-level GitHubActionsSecrets.

    ```
    (GitHubEnvironment)-[:HAS_SECRET]->(GitHubActionsSecret {level: "environment"})
    ```

- GitHubOrganizations are sub-resources for environment-level GitHubActionsSecrets (for cleanup scoping).

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[:RESOURCE]->(GitHubActionsSecret {level: "environment"})
    ```


### GitHubActionsVariable

Represents a GitHub Actions variable. Variables can exist at three levels: organization, repository, or environment.
Unlike secrets, variable **values are stored in plaintext**.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| firstseen | Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node |
| lastupdated | Timestamp of the last time the node was updated |
| **id** | Unique identifier (composite URL based on level) |
| **name** | Name of the variable |
| **value** | Value of the variable (plaintext) |
| **level** | Level of the variable: `organization`, `repository`, or `environment` |
| **visibility** | Visibility setting (organization-level only): `all`, `private`, or `selected` |
| **created_at** | Timestamp when the variable was created |
| **updated_at** | Timestamp when the variable was last updated |

#### Relationships
